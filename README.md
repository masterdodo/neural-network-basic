# Neural networks
Learning neural networks from scratch.

This example implements all the basic concepts used for neural networks like metrices operations, forward pass, computing errors and backward pass (backpropagation) and activation functions, without using any existing libraries for them. 

#### Train & Test DATA

The data is available through `kaggle`:
```sh
kaggle datasets download -d oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
unzip mnist-in-csv.zip -d data
```

Another way is downloading the `train` and `test` sets directly from the website in the `References`.
